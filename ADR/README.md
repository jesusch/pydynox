# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This folder contains Architecture Decision Records - documents that capture important decisions made during the project's development.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a short document that describes a decision, why it was made, and what the consequences are. It helps future contributors understand the "why" behind the codebase.
